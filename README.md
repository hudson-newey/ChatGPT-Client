# ChatGPT-Client

**This project no longer serves a purpose as you can just use the OpenAI API playground to use GPT 4 with API prices. Therefore, this repository will no longer receive updates**

---

Allows you to use a "pay as you go" model for chat-gpt/gpt-4

I didn't want to pay $20 a month because I found that if I just paid for api access, it'd be cheaper.

I also made this client so I could learn how to use [pnpm](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm) + [Tailwind](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) + [NextJS](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) + [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux)

## To Run

Modify the `environment.example.ts` file and fill in your information and rename to `environment.ts`

```sh
> pnpm dev
$
```
